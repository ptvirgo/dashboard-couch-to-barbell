# Dashboard: Couch to Barbell

Remind me how much I'm lifting for the Couch-to-Barbell exercises.

## Usage

Click one of the exercises to edit the amount of weight, and use the `✓`  or `✗` button to indicate whether or not you could complete all the sets. Come back later and lift heavier when you can.

## Build / Install

It's Purescript.

    $ spago bundle-app -t dist/app.js

Then web-server + browser to dist/index.html.
